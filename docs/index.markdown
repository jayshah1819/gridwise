Gridwise provides WebGPU compute primitives in JavaScript. Its current supported primitives are reduce, scan, and sort, and it is built atop infrastructure to make the development and performance analysis of future primitives as straightforward as possible. Gridwise was developed during a sabbatical year at Google from August 2024--August 2025.
